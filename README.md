# Deep-Q-Learning-game

An obstacle based game along with an agent that learns to play the game using reinforcement learning (deep Q learning)

### Description
In this project. an obstacle based has been created that is very difficult for humans to play, as it requires quick reactions and ability to think about the futures states. The aim of this project is to create a bot to play this game for us.

Reinforcement Learning in a branch of machine learning where the agent learns about an environment (the game) through process of trial / error and delayed rewards. Deep-Q Learning has been used to train the agent. After sufficient training, the bot becomes invincible in the game.

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3
1. NumPy
1. TensorFlow
